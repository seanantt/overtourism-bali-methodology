# Overtourism in Bali â€“ Methodology

The methodology includes data collection, text classification using BERT, spatial analysis with Kernel Density Estimation, and Pearson correlation to analyze the relationship between infrastructure and perceived overcrowding in Bali.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The research aims to analyze perceived overcrowding in Bali's top tourist destinations using sentiment analysis on user reviews (TripAdvisor) and geospatial infrastructure mapping (OpenStreetMap). The methodology combines text classification (BERT-based), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and spatial correlation techniques to detect overtourism patterns.
